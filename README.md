This repository contains simple Projects in Bioinformatics, Biosignal and Medical imaging Analysis (under development....)
## Overview
Bioinformatics, as related to genetics and genomics, is a scientific subdiscipline that involves using computer technology to collect, store, analyze and disseminate biological data and information, such as DNA and amino acid sequences or annotations about those sequences.
Biological signals, or biosignals, are space, time, or space-time records of a biological event such as a beating heart or a contracting muscle. The electrical, chemical, and mechanical activity that occurs during this biological event often produces signals that can be measured and analyzed.
Medical imaging is the technique and process of imaging the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as visual representation of the function of some organs or tissues (physiology). Medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose and treat disease. Medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities. Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging.
