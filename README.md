# Bioinformatics and Biosignal Analysis
This repository contains my Bioinformatics project
## Overview
Bioinformatics, as related to genetics and genomics, is a scientific subdiscipline that involves using computer technology to collect, store, analyze and disseminate biological data and information, such as DNA and amino acid sequences or annotations about those sequences.
Biological signals, or biosignals, are space, time, or space-time records of a biological event such as a beating heart or a contracting muscle. The electrical, chemical, and mechanical activity that occurs during this biological event often produces signals that can be measured and analyzed.
